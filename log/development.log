Nuestros vendedores tienen consolas como NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, y PlayStation, y videoconsolas portÃ¡tiles como el original Game Boy. Para encontrar todos estos productos, haz una bÃºsqueda por palabras clave y filtra los resultados por marca, precio o mÃ¡s.\r\n\r\nÂ¿CuÃ¡l es la historia de los videojuegos?\r\n\r\nLa historia de los videojuegos comenzÃ³ en 1974, con la creaciÃ³n de un juego electrÃ³nico interactivo en un tubo de rayo catÃ³dico. A ese le siguieron otros juegos hasta que en 1972 llegÃ³ la primera consola, la Magnavox Odyssey. Ese mismo aÃ±o, un simple simulador de mesa de tenis llamado \"Pong\" se convirtiÃ³ en la primera mÃ¡quina arcade con Ã©xito comercial, lo que llevÃ³ a que se hiciera una versiÃ³n para uso casero que se puso en venta en 1975 y provocÃ³ el auge de las consolas caseras.\r\nInicialmente, las imitaciones inundaron el mercado, pero la caÃ­da de los videojuegos en 1983 resultÃ³ en la descontinuaciÃ³n de la mayorÃ­a de consolas. En 1985, el lanzamiento en Estados Unidos del Sistema de Entretenimiento Nintendo (NES por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) introdujo un nueva era de videojuegos y la industria ha crecido desde entonces.", "status"=>"1", "url"=>"Sample", "category_id"=>"3", "user_id"=>"2"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"7"}
